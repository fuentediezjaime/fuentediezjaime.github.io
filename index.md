I’m a soon-to-graduate PhD in Physical Chemistry, specializing in path integral simulations to study Vibrational Strong Coupling (VSC) under Professor Rodolphe Vuilleumier at ENS Paris. My work focuses on understanding how VSC impacts molecular behavior, combining theory with computational modeling to explore quantum effects in complex chemical systems.

Originally from Valladolid, Spain, I’ve been hooked on chemistry since childhood, when my favorite “experiments” involved mixing things from the kitchen (usually without much success—except the iconic vinegar and baking soda reaction). This early curiosity grew into a more serious path: I earned my Bachelor’s in Chemistry at the University of Valladolid, followed by a European Master’s in Theoretical Chemistry and Computational Modelling, where I graduated with honors, receiving the Extraordinary Master’s Award. An Erasmus+ fellowship brought me to ENS Paris for my master’s thesis, and I decided to stay on for a PhD with Professor Vuilleumier.

In my doctoral work, I’ve developed strong skills in **quantum simulations**, **path integrals**, and **computational chemistry**. I am familiar with many of the most popular quantum chemistry softwares, such as **Gaussian**, **Orca**, **CFOUR**, **Quantum Expresso** or the molecular dynamics library **NAMD**. Through my research, I’ve also built solid programming skills in Fortran and Python, using libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn or Tensorflow, with extensive experience in Linux environments and in task automation using shell scripts. Also, as most of my work has involved developing software, I have become very familiar with the use of **Git** as a version tracking and code sharing tool.

I am interested at multiple aspects of computational chemistry. I’m fascinated by how simulations can provide insights into systems as complex as chemical reactions, especially where quantum phenomena are involved. I believe the future of chemistry will lean heavily on computation, whether through physics-based methods or machine learning, and I’m excited to be part of that movement.

I’m also working on machine learning applications in chemistry, developing simple models for university data challenges and collaborating on new molecular descriptors that incorporate quantum information. It’s exciting to be at the intersection of these fields, pushing the boundaries of what we can predict about molecular behavior. You can find some of this projects on my GitHub profile (or you will soon enough). If you think that we can colaborate or discuss, do not hesitate on writing a message!
