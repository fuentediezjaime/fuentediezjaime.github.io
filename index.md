# Studies
I am a soon to graduate PhD in physical chemistry. I was born in Spain, and since I was a kid my favourite game was to mix different things (mostly from the kitchen) to see what happened (normally nothing, except for the famous vinegar + bicarbonate combo). Not surprisingly, some years later I decided to enroll in a bachelor in Chemistry at the University of Valladolid, my hometown.

Towards the end of my bachelor's I did my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of professor Carmen Barrientos, during which I carried out a computational study dealing the possible formation of some aromatic molecules of astrochemical interest in the Interstellar Medium. In particular, I studied the formation of simple molecules through bimolecular collisions between bezene and relatively abundant fragments in gas clouds, such as CN radicals. In order to do that, I used the Gaussian electronic structure suite to optimize the structures of both reactants and products as well as to obtain estimates of their free energies. Also, I performed transtion state searches to evaluate the barrier of activation of the hypothetical reactions.

Furthermore, as chemical species in the interstellar mediu

To increase our knowledge about these structures, the topological analysis of their electronic density, in particular its critical points as well as its laplacian was done using the Atoms In Molecules (AIM) suite of programs by .


It was during this project when I discovered my interest for computational physical chemistry. This led me to enroll in the European Master in Theoretical Chemistry and Computational Modelling (EM-TCCM) at the University of Valladolid, which is a member of the international consortium organizing the Master.
