# Studies
I am a soon to graduate PhD in physical chemistry. I was born in spain and I followed a bachelor's in chemistry at the University of Valladolid. At the end of my bachelor's I did my undergraduate thesis under the direction of professor Carmen Barrientos, during which I carried out a study dealing with the electronic spectroscopy of some aromatic molecules of interstellar interest, as well as the exploration of some possible synthetic pathways for them. In order to do that, the Gaussian16 suite for molecular electronic structure was used to perform DFT and perturbation theory calculations dealing with stable structures for the molecules and the possible transition states connecting them.

To increase our knowledge about these structures, the topological analysis of their electronic density, in particular its critical points as well as its laplacian was done using the Atoms In Molecules (AIM) suite of programs by .


It was during this project when I discovered my interest for computational physical chemistry. This led me to enroll in the European Master in Theoretical Chemistry and Computational Modelling (EM-TCCM) at the University of Valladolid, which is a member of the international consortium organizing the Master.
