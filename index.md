# Studies
I am a soon to graduate PhD in Physical Chemistry, working on path integral simulations of Vibrational Strong Coupling under the supervision of professor Rodolphe Vuilleumier at ENS Paris. 

I was born in Spain, at the city of Valladolid. Since I was a kid my favourite game was to mix different things (mostly from the kitchen) to see what happened (normally nothing, except for the famous vinegar + bicarbonate combo and some "curious" tastes). Not surprisingly, some years later I decided to enroll in a bachelor in Chemistry at the University of Valladolid, and this led me to specialize in computational chemistry by attending th European Master's in Theoretical Chemistry and Computational Modelling from the University of Valladolid, which belongs to the european consortium organizing the master. Finally, after completing my master's thesis during an Eramus+ stay at the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure of Paris under the supervision of professor Rodolphe Vuilleumier, I stayed there to do my PhD research with professor Vuilleumier, which I will defend in early December.

I am fascinated by the fact that computational simulations can provide insight into systems as complex and messy as chemical reactions, specially in the consequences of quantum phenomena in chemistry, as may be the case in Vibrational Strong Coupling.
